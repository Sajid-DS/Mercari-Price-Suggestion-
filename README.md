# Problem Statement 
### Mercari, the community-powered shopping app price suggestion.
Product pricing gets even harder at scale, considering just how many products are sold online. Clothing has strong seasonal pricing trends and is heavily influenced by brand names, while electronics have fluctuating prices based on product specs.
The objective of this project is to gain insights into the factors influencing the sale price of an item listing based on the information provided by a user. By performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) and conducting statistical and probabilistic analysis on a dataset of item listings and associated user-provided informationÂ .
